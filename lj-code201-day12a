# LJ Code 201 - Day 12 (Monday)

Today I learned that I have actually absorbed more of the concepts
than I thought.

I skinned out the HTML scaffold in about 10 minutes, following the
wireframe example and, when I realized it was pretty much done, it 
hit me.  I actually did this.  

Then, I threw in the js script and got one item to display properly.
SCORE !

Then, I hit the logic and everything ground to a halt, but. . . I
kept thinking about it last night and I may have a solution to 
try and implement today.  

Retention !  Yay !  Application of concept/s !  YAY !
