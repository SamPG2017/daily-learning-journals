# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Today I learned that I have a better understanding of how to
set up a for loop, even using array elements - though it took
me a little while to figure out the mistake I made early on.

I learned that I am dependent on my notes right now for GitHub and that
somewhere I got lost in translation today.  I need to get <so much better> 
at this -- even to the point where I can fix mistakes as soon as they are 
made.  Obviously, the point is not to make them, but IF they happen, I 
need to know how to correct them immediately.  

I remembered to ask my classmates for help and that is VERY difficult
for me.  I am used to working problems out on my own -- and have been
that way for many years, so me asking for help is a skill on its own.
