# LJ Code 201 - Day 12 (Sunday)

Today I learned that I CAN code.  It just takes me WAY longer
than I want.  

It bothers me tremendously that what I am turning in tonight is
awful - it looks terrible and doesn't have nearly the items 
in it that were requested, but the functionality took me so 
long to resolve that nothing else I planned was possible.

I CAN get this, but it's going to take me much more time to 
get fast enough to keep up with the accelerated timeline.

My inner voice is less negative on the concepts, but still
pretty harsh on the time required.  Tankity-tankity-tank.
