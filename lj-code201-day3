# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today I learned how to set up a function -- the structure and syntax.

In lab, I know we got the function working to generate questions
using the for loop from yesterday, but I'm still not confident that 
I have everything the way I want it to be. I learned that I code very 
differently from my lab partner and that it is very frustrating to me
to try and work with someone who works so differently from me, 
especially when I want us both to succeed so much. 

I have started feeling a little more confident in my ability to use
most of the required tools, including the terminal and the terminal
commands, including git status, ACP, and navigating up and down the 
file structure/tree.  I am still not sure my file structure works as
intended because I think I set things up initially differently than 
best practice.  I'm getting better, but this is something else to practice.

Got my CSS file looking a little better instead of the dumpster fire that
my webpage looked like yesterday.  Figured out more about how to use the 
<div> and <p> elements to set up appropriate white space and it will 
continue to improve.  

I took tonight off from the js file because I needed to focus my energy
elsewhere and let my mind try and sort out a solution on the back burner.
I think I'm very close to that solution, but the frustration from this
afternoon is still very much top of mind and I'm concerned that I will 
make a huge error on code that is, at the very least, still functional.
