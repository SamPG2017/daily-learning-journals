# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

As Reddit is prone to say, TIL. MAN, did I learn.

I learned that incremental saves will save your bacon - but you have to do them 
BEFORE you accidentally delete your code while trying to refactor the stupid nesting.
 
I practiced how to rewrite an HTML frame from scratch in order to hang the CSS & JS
pieces off it.

I learned that ALL your tools have to work together as a team or it's just 100 times
more difficult.

I learned that I knew more about HTML, CSS, & JS than I thought I did, even though 
it's been literally years since I've practiced most of the skills.  CSS is going to 
be the death of me.  It's the one glaring weak spot and the thing I'll have to 
practice on the most.  Everything else is reasonably understandable to me, but CSS 
is definitely my struggle bus right now.

I learned that this is not easy, not by a longshot.  I didn't really expect it to
be, but even these two days have been super-hard.  I haven't cried, I haven't quit.
