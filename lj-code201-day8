# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Today I learned that I am slow, slow, slow.  

The concepts in theory I understand, but putting them to 
practical use takes me much more time than I want.

It's very frustrating to me to realize that I am not the
"smart one" in this class -- that's not been my experience
earlier in life.  This also makes it very hard for me to
ask for help.  I do, but it's still difficult.

I am still struggling, but not giving up.
