# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today I learned that I know more now that I think I do, but that I still have
a long way to go to feel comfortable.  

I appreciated the reminder this morning from Allie about perspective.  After 
struggling so much last week (even when I thought I knew what I was doing), 
her reminder that this is only Day 6 of this process reminded me to think 
more about the things I <have> learned and less about my shortcomings.

I still feel very much behind the learning curve, but I see every day things
that are becoming automatic.  Git adds, commits (with messages), and pushes 
to branch are almost second nature now.  I definitely didn't expect that and
it gives me hope that more of these new concepts will begin to make sense 
a little later.
