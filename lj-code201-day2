# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Today I learned how to set up a for loop to iterate through user prompts
  and how to structure them in a way that makes it easy to both write and read later.

I think I am retaining more than I think I am because the protocol of ACP -
  Add, Commit, Push is feeling much more comfortable today, although I'm
  a little freaked out that I don't see the file I expect on GitHub.  
  The last commit shows a day ago and I KNOW I've worked on it and ACPed
  all day today.  
  
  I checked the terminal, but I have no way (that I know now of) to see 
  if code is being checked in to a place I can't see.  

  I sent a Slack message and will work to fix this tomorrow.
  
Today I learned how to set up nested for loops to increment through an array.

Today I learned that I either have to get better and/or faster or I'm
going to die from sleep deprivation.
