# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Today I learned that I am understanding most of the lecture
material but it is just not translating to my actual code 
writing yet.

I know that I am so far behind because it has taken me
so long to get Monday's stuff done (and Tuesday's refactoring
is still a damn mess) that I am way behind the 8-ball on this
particular lab.

Yesterday was just a nightmare.  I made the stupidest rookie
mistake by not including a <script> tag in my sales.html page.
After working with Cat for almost 45 minutes, she caught it, but
by that time, all the changes in the js page had me so confused
that I didn't know how to fix them. 

I need to remember (and I try to do this) every day that this 
is a much more accelerated timeline.  I did some math last night
-- and math is not my friend -- where I figured out that a four-year
degree in this is basically being translated to 20 weeks.  1 year/
every five weeks.  52 weeks / 5 weeks. 

Every. week. I. learn. here. is. equal. to. 10. weeks. elsewhere.
I have learned over 15 weeks' worth of information.  (I'm not saying
20 yet, because it's not cemented yet.)

Growth.  Mindset.
